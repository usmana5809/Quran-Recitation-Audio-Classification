# Quran Recitation Audio Classification

## Overview
The Quran Recitation Audio Classification project aims to classify different recitations of the Quran using machine learning techniques. It involves preprocessing Quranic audio data, extracting relevant features, training machine learning models, and deploying a classification system.

## Setup
### Prerequisites
- Python (>=3.6)
- Libraries: pandas, librosa, scikit-learn, joblib

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
 ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/quran-recitation-audio-classification.git
   cd quran-reInstall dependencies:
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Usage
## 1.Data Preparation:
- Ensure your Quran recitation audio files are organized in a structured format.
- Update config.py or relevant scripts with your dataset paths and configurations.
  
## 2.Data Extract:
- download or extract the data from kaggle website or any other website

## 3.Data Path:
- Example of configuring dataset paths in config.py
```bash
DATA_PATH = 'path/to/dataset'
```
## 4.Feature Extraction:
- Run feature extraction scripts to preprocess audio data and extract relevant features:
```bash
python extract_features.py
```
## 5.Model Training:
- Train the classification model using extracted features:
```bash
python train_model.py
```
##  6.Model Evaluation:
- Evaluate the trained model's performance:
```bash
python evaluate_model.py
```
## 7.Deployment:
Deploy the model for real-time classification (optional).

# Expected Output
- Classification of Quran recitations based on extracted audio features.
- Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for model evaluation.
